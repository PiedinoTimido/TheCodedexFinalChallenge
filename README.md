# TheCod-dexFinalChallenge
We create a phaser game styled like a codédex. Each chapter ends with a boss fight where you must code to win. For example, in the Python course, you get a Python sword and face a boss after each chapter by answering questions correctly. Lumi helps with hints and upgrades. The final boss is a Python.
